Hand cricket is a simple game that can be played with just two people and requires nothing more than your hands and a bit of imagination.
The game is typically played by children and involves one player "bowling" by making a fist and then opening it to reveal a number between 1 and 6. 
The other player "bats" by holding their hands together to form a number, and if their number matches the bowler's number, they are out.
If their number is different, they score runs based on the number they formed with their hands. 
The game continues until the batsman is out or until a predetermined number of overs or runs have been completed
